# Git Workflow Guide

## Branch Strategy
Currently using single `main` branch for development and deployment.

## Daily Workflow
```bash
# Before starting work
git pull origin main

# Making changes
git add .
git commit -m "description of changes"
git push origin main
```

## Commit Message Guidelines
Use clear, descriptive messages explaining what changed and why.
